Collaborating
-------------

If you like that project and you want to collaborate there is some
parts where you can do something that you know.

    * Create a 'library'.
    * 'translate' to your mother language.
    * 'package' for your favourite distribution.
    * If you are a coder take a look to the TODO file.

Translations
------------

To generate translations file .po exec:

$ cd po
$ intltool-update es

'es' is the language code. Then you need to translate the .po file.

You can send any collaboration to 'AUTHORS' and I will be happy.
